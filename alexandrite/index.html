   <p>The history of Alexandrite is an interesting one.This very rare gemstone is named after the Russian tsar Alexander II (1818-1881). The very first crystals were said to have been discovered in April 1834 in the emerald mines near the Tokovaya River in the Urals. Legend is that the discovery was made on the day the future tsar came of age. Since it shows both red and green, the principal colors of old Imperial Russia, it inevitably became the national stone of tsarist Russia. Although alexandrite is a relatively young gemstone, it certainly has a noble upbringing.</p>
